## Overview

A real-time data engineering project that ingests live stock market data from Yahoo Finance, streams events through Apache Kafka, processes data using Spark Structured Streaming, stores data in a multi-layered lakehouse architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and visualizes analytics through Streamlit.
